# TCGPlayerTxt-to-YDK
Converts a TCGPlayer Decklist text file into a .ydk file... If that's something you need.

Requires the requests module (https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

Known Issues:

To be found...

Fixed Issues:

1. Main deck is not imported into Dueling Book, only Extra and Side deck.

Future Plans:

- Adapt for other decklist txt file styles if the need be.
- Add a batch convert option (Convert multiple files at a time).
- Make a GUI version of the script (if there is a demand for it).
- Make an optimized query to the api (only receive cards in deck instead of all yugioh cards)
